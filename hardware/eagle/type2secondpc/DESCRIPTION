Simulator Type 2 Second PC Board<br>
Rev A<br>
04/2019<br>
Allows a second PC to be daisy-chained between the Power Board and Interface.<br>
Requires Interface Board Rev D or later, or the following mod to the Interface board:<br>
 - Connect pins 1 and 2 of IC2 together (IC2 is the MAX233), a solder bridge on the solder side of the board will do,<br>
 - Connect an insulated wire link between Pin 18 of IC2 and either Pin 6 of the RJ45 or Pin 2 of TP5 on the solder side of the board.<br>
 - Connecting to TP5 is probably easier.
