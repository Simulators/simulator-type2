MR sensor package silk screen X = +0.1
MR sensor package pad centres X = -0.2 & -0.3
MR sensor package drill size = 0.02362205
Hence silk screen edge to pad hole centres:
X = 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3
X = 0.1 + 0.3 = 0.4
Half the pad hole = 0.02362205 / 2 = 0.012
Hence silk screen edge X to nearer edge of pad holes:
X = 0.3 - 0.012 = 0.288
X = 0.4 - 0.012 = 0.388

Bottom edge of board Y = 0
Hence edge to silk screen guides:
Y = 0 + 0.288 = 0.288
Y = 0 + 0.388 = 0.388

Width of package = 0.2
Hence silk screen guide lines
X = -0.1 & X = +0.1
Y = +0.288 & Y = +0.388
This allows the edge of the board to be used as a guide for forming the VR legs
