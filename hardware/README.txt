*** If you just want to order PCBs from a fabrication house, ready-made Gerber files can be found in the Gerbers directory ***

If you require PCB CAD files, please use those in the "kicad" subdirectory. The CAD files in the "eagle" subdirectory are the last to be produced using Eagle prior to migration of PCB development to KiCad. Those are provided for reference only, and are no longer maintained.
