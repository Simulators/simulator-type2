# The TYpe 2 Liverpool Ringing Simulator

In this repository you will find all the resources for building the Liverpool Ringing Simulator Project's Type 2 simulator interfaces and sensor heads, including:
* Hardware & Software Manuals
* Firmware Source Code
* Eagle PCB Designs
* PCB Fabrication Gerber Files

You probably want to start in the docs folder above...

Please note that this is a Build-it-Yourself project. No pre-built hardware is available.

In view of the restrictions on ringing arising from COVID-19, there are currently no plans for further development of the Liverpool Simulator.

The original (Type 1) Liverpool Simulator hardware and code can be found in the legacy repository at https://github.com/Simulators/simulator. The Type 1 simulator is no longer under active development.

If you didn't get here from http://www.simulators.org.uk/, you might want to go and look at that, too.
